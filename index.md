## About {#about}

DRAM is predominantly used to build the main memory systems of modern computing
devices. To improve performance, reliability, and security, it is critical to
conduct both system-level simulation studies and experimental characterization
of cutting-edge DRAM chips. Simulation enables understanding of the complex
interactions between DRAM, emerging memory technologies, and modern
applications, while real-chip characterization provides concrete insights into
DRAM performance, robustness, latency, and power under different conditions
(e.g., temperature and voltage).

This tutorial+workshop will introduce simulation-based DRAM research together
with experimental DRAM characterization using real DRAM chips. We will provide an extensive overview of: <a href="https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/ramulator2">Ramulator</a>, a cycle-accurate and extensible main memory simulator,
and <a href="https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/DRAM-Bender">DRAM Bender</a>, an FPGA-based DRAM testing infrastructure.

### Ramulator

<span class="emph-nobreak">Ramulator</span> is an extensible main memory simulator that provides <span class="emph-nobreak">cycle-level performance models for a variety of commercial DRAM standards</span> (e.g., DDR3/4, LPDDR3/4, GDDR5, HBM), <span class="emph-nobreak">emerging memory technologies</span>, and <span class="emph-nobreak">academic proposals</span>. Its modular design enables easy integration of additional standards, technologies, and mechanisms. Ramulator is written in C++ and can be easily integrated into both full-system simulators, such as <span class="emph-nobreak">gem5</span>, as well as other microarchitectural simulators, <span class="emph-nobreak">zsim</span>, and <span class="emph-nobreak">Virtuoso</span>.

### DRAM Bender

<span class="emph-nobreak">DRAM Bender</span> (based on SoftMC), is <span class="emph-nobreak">an FPGA-based DRAM testing infrastructure</span>. DRAM Bender provides <span class="emph-nobreak">simple and intuitive high-level programming interfaces</span> in C++ and Python. A user of DRAM Bender writes DRAM test programs in a high-level language. DRAM Bender's programmer interface automatically translates these programs into low-level DRAM Bender instructions (e.g., DRAM commands, arithmetic, memory, control-flow instructions) on the FPGA. Thereby, DRAM Bender enables users with diverse technical backgrounds to <span class="emph-nobreak">rapidly characterize DRAM without requiring logic design expertise</span>.

    <div class="speaker-talk-title">Realistic DRAM Timing for HLS: Closing the Memory Fidelity Gap with Ramulator-Backed Co-Simulation</div>
    <div class="speaker-abstract-label">Abstract</div>
    <p class="speaker-abstract">High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools typically model off-chip memory using fixed-latency stubs, masking the dominant performance factors of real DRAM systems - row activations, bank conflicts, scheduling effects, and refresh interference. This memory fidelity gap causes cycle estimates to deviate by 1.5-2.5x on common compute kernels and by nearly 2x on parallel graph workloads, often misleading design-space exploration and delaying memory-sensitive decisions until FPGA deployment.</p>
    <p class="speaker-abstract">We present a cycle-accurate DRAM co-simulation framework that replaces Bambu's fixed-latency memory backend with Ramulator-2.0 through a protocol-faithful AXI4 bridge. Our design introduces a non-blocking request/completion interface, tag-preserving out-of-order response handling, and bidirectional back-pressure control, all integrated through SystemVerilog DPI-C and IPC layers without modifying upstream HLS flow. The combined system preserves functional correctness while exposing realistic DRAM timing and concurrency behavior.</p>
    <p class="speaker-abstract">Evaluated on 13 PolyBench kernels, multiple MachSuite workloads, and SPARTA-generated multi-threaded graph accelerators targeting a Xilinx Alveo U250 and a matched DDR4-2400R model, our co-simulation reveals that fixed-delay models either substantially under-predict or over-predict runtime - and that no single scalar delay can match true DRAM behavior across kernels or parallelism levels. Under maximum spatial x temporal parallelism, fixed-delay models converge to nearly identical results yet remain approximately 2x too optimistic, exposing structural memory-system effects (controller queuing, bank conflicts, refresh contention) that simple per-access constants cannot capture.</p>
    <p class="speaker-abstract">Our results demonstrate that realistic DRAM timing is essential for trustworthy HLS performance estimation, and that cycle-accurate memory co-simulation can replace many costly FPGA iterations during accelerator design.</p>
    <div class="speaker-bio-label">Bio</div>
    <p class="speaker-bio">Dr. Antonino Tumeo received an MS degree in Informatic Engineering (2005) and a PhD in Computer Engineering (2009) from Politecnico di Milano in Italy. Since February 2011, he has been a research scientist in Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's (PNNL) Future Computing Technologies group. He joined PNNL in 2009 as a post-doctoral research associate. Previously, he was a post-doctoral researcher at Politecnico di Milano. His research focuses on custom systems for graph analytics, electronic design automation (including high-level synthesis), and in general hardware specialization, fostering the creation of an open hardware design ecosystem. Recently, he also started research in the area of analog computing, specifically focusing on chemical computing.</p>

She is broadly interested in computer architecture and, more specifically, in security, reliability, and safety (robustness) of memory systems, emerging memory and computation paradigms, including Processing-In-Memory architectures (PIM), and designing effective and efficient solutions to address robustness issues in modern and future systems. Her recent works uncover and mitigate new security vulnerabilities that emerge with the adoption of read disturbance solutions and PIM architectures to aid in designing robust future systems.
